# Connectivity Check

## 1. Lab access general description

The lab has been built leveraging multiple cloud environments as following:

- Amazon Web Services
- Private intrastructure on-prem

You will have access to Cisco Intersight GUI, where you will see  Kubernetes Clusters deployed On-Prem. In the end you will manage your application that will be deployed in 2 different environments. The infrastructure between On-prem and AWS is ready and functioning. In this lab you will see how to connect microservices together to make whole application work.
Most of the tasks you will do from Linux Jumphost that is running on-premise. From there you will deploy components of your application in Kubernetes Cluster in AWS and on-prem.

## 2. Cisco dCloud dashboard

The entire lab for the session is built using Cisco dCloud environment.
Access to the Session will be provided by the proctor assigned to you.

When you click on "Remote Desktop button, browser will open new TAB with access to Windows desktop. The webRDP has installed Chrome as web browser, from where you get access to CCP GUI.
WinSCP will be used to upload kubeconfig files to your Linux jump host. To access CSR router and Linux jumphost, use Putty installed - shortcut is on Desktop.

!!! info
	Please do not use "Remote Desktop" for other devices from the list at **Network** tab. ONLY win2k16 can be accessed that way.

!!! tip
	If you use webRDP you are still able to copy/paste between your 'main PC' and webRDP interface. You can use Guacamole interface - explained in Appendix: Guacamole.
