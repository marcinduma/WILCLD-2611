# Connectivity Check

## 1. Lab access general description

The lab has been built leveraging multiple cloud environments as following:

- Amazon Web Services
- Private intrastructure on-prem

You will have access to Cisco Container Platform GUI, where you will setup new Kubernetes Clusters deployed in AWS and On-Prem. In the end you will manage your application that will be deployed in 2 different environments. In this lab you will see how to connect microservices together to make whole application work.
Most of the tasks you will do from Linux Jumphost that is running on-premise. From there you will deploy components of your application in Kubernetes Cluster in AWS and on-prem.

## 2. Cisco dCloud dashboard

The entire lab for the session is built using Cisco dCloud environment. To access it, you need to login to eXpo dashboard first.
